- The project **Clustering Countries** is based on CLUSTERING COUNTRIES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND HEALTH RELATED NEEDS.
- This project was an example of **Unsupervised Learning amongst the machines** which seeks to **CLUSTER** similar countries together 
using the **K-Means++ Clustering Algorithm**
- The most in need countries were clustered together depending upon various factors like **income per capita, health expenditure by gov.
per capita, mortality rate of children under 5 years of age** and some other important factors which determined **the overall develoment** 
of a country.
- All the relevant **score plots, histograms and EDA plots are included**.
- The notebook, **Clustering Countries.ipynb** contains the final notebook.
