# LinearRegression

The linear regression model used in the given test data set for students is based on the LEAST SQUARES METHOD. The model takes independent variable as the number of hours a student puts in for coding and the dependent variable is the performance achieved by the student.

This Bivariate Regression model -

- takes in a dependent value list X

- takes in an independent value list Y

- evaluates the best fit line parameters using the function line(X,Y)

- line returns a list of parameters in list object mb

- mb[0] corresponds to the "slope" of the line and mb[1] corresponds to the "constant" of the line

- matplotlib and pandas libraries are used to import the files and evaluates scatter plots.
