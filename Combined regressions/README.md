# Combined Regressions
- The aim of this project is to use multiple regression algorithms to correctly predict the ** Prices per unit area of the Houses** for the given real estate data.
- The models employed in the project were linear and polynomial regressions.
- The regression techniques used in the models were **Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression** and an introduction about each is provided in the code.
- The code **combinedregressions.ipynb** contains the all the necessary EDA and model training.
- All the graphs and plots are also attached separately for viewing.
